PROBLEM STATEMENT:
    In our everyday life, travellers pay an assured amount of tax all the way through toll plaza to the government. The national highways and bridges have toll gates, where people pay the charges for using the highways by standing in the queue, leading to unnecessary break of journey. Therefore, in order to abstain this issue, this proposed system approach for automating the payments of toll plaza by detucting payment amount from the customer's pre recharged account created in database. In the proposed work, the user is allowed to register with their VIN number and have their accounts recharged. At every toll booth the picture of the vehicle is captured to obtain VIN number.

WHY?
   We have the toll systems to track the individual crossing the toll plaza using RFID.In this system we use image processing to capture the vehicle and extract the number.

PREREQUISITES:
   Must have the XAMPP server installed.
